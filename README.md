A Generative AI application designed for HR professionals and recruiters to instantly draft high-quality, professional job advertisements. By utilizing **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, this tool ensures that generated ads are grounded in real-world data scraped from top job portals like LinkedIn.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Writing the perfect job description from scratch is time-consuming. This tool solves that by combining the creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the relevance of real market data.

**Key Workflow:**
1.  **User Input:** The user provides basic details (Role, Company, Location, Tech Stack).
2.  **Semantic Search:** The system queries a local **FAISS Vector Database** containing thousands of scraped job descriptions to find historically similar roles.
3.  **Context Augmentation:** These "real-world" examples are retrieved and fed into the LLM as context.
4.  **Generation:** The **Groq API (openai/gpt-oss-20b)** generates 3 distinct, professional job ad variants based on the user's requirements and the retrieved context.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a standard RAG pipeline:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Job postings were scraped from various portals (LinkedIn, etc.).
2.  **Vector Store:** Data was cleaned, tokenized, and converted into embeddings using `Sentence-Transformers`. These embeddings are stored in a local **FAISS** index.
3.  **Retrieval:** When a user asks for a "Data Scientist" role, the app performs a similarity search in FAISS to find the top 4 most relevant existing job ads.
4.  **Generation:** A prompt is constructed (`User Input` + `Retrieved Job Context`) and sent to the **openai/gpt-oss-20b** model via Groq to produce the final output.
